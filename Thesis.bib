@article{Bonavera:2021aa,
  abstract      = {Point sources (PS) are one of the main contaminants to the recovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal at small scales, and their detection is important for the next generation of CMB experiments. We develop a method (PoSeIDoN) based on fully convolutional networks to detect PS in realistic simulations, and we compare its performance against one of the most used PS detection method, the Mexican hat wavelet 2 (MHW2). We produce realistic simulations of PS taking into account contaminating signals as the CMB, the cosmic infrared background, the Galactic thermal emission, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and the instrumental and PS shot noises. We first produce a set of training simulations at 217 GHz to train the network. Then we apply both PoSeIDoN and the MHW2 to recover the PS in the validating simulations at all 143, 217, and 353 GHz, comparing the results by estimating the reliability, completeness, and flux density accuracy and by computing the receiver operating characteristic curves. In the extra-galactic region with a 30$\,^{\circ}$ galactic cut, the network successfully recovers PS at 90% completeness corresponding to 253, 126, and 250 mJy for 143, 217, and 353 GHz respectively. The MHW2 with a 3$σ$ flux density detection limit recovers PS up to 181, 102, and 153 mJy at 90% completeness. In all cases PoSeIDoN produces a much lower number of spurious sources with respect to MHW2. The results on spurious sources for both techniques worsen when reducing the galactic cut to 10$\,^{\circ}$. Our results suggest that using neural networks is a very promising approach for detecting PS, providing overall better results in dealing with spurious sources with respect to usual filtering approaches. Moreover, PoSeIDoN gives competitive results even at nearby frequencies where the network was not trained.},

  abstract      = {Bayesian model selection provides a powerful framework for objectively comparing models directly from observed data, without reference to ground truth data. However, Bayesian model selection requires the computation of the marginal likelihood (model evidence), which is computationally challenging, prohibiting its use in many high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. With Bayesian imaging applications in mind, in this work we present the proximal nested sampling methodology to objectively compare alternative Bayesian imaging models for applications that use images to inform decisions under uncertainty. The methodology is based on nested sampling, a Monte Carlo approach specialised for model comparison, and exploits proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to scale efficiently to large problems and to tackle models that are log-concave and not necessarily smooth (e.g., involving l_1 or total-variation priors). The proposed approach can be applied computationally to problems of dimension O(10^6) and beyond, making it suitable for high-dimensional inverse imaging problems. It is validated on large Gaussian models, for which the likelihood is available analytically, and subsequently illustrated on a range of imaging problems where it is used to analyse different choices of dictionary and measurement model.},

  abstract      = {Common object counting in a natural scene is a challenging problem in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. Existing image-level supervised common object counting approaches only predict the global object count and rely on additional instance-level supervision to also determine object locations. We propose an image-level supervised approach that provides both the global object count and the spatial distribution of object instances by constructing an object category density map. Motivated by psychological studies, we further reduce image-level supervision using a limited object count information (up to four). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose image-level supervised density map estimation for common object counting and demonstrate its effectiveness in image-level supervised instance segmentation. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms existing methods, including those using instance-level supervision, on both datasets for common object counting. Moreover, our approach improves state-of-the-art image-level supervised instance segmentation with a relative gain of 17.8% in terms of average best overlap, on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

  abstract      = {We introduce the TangoSIDM project, a suite of cosmological simulations of structure formation in a $Λ$-Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) universe. TangoSIDM explores the impact of large dark matter (DM) scattering cross sections over dwarf galaxy scales. Motivated by DM interactions that follow a Yukawa potential, the cross section per unit mass, $σ/m_χ$, assumes a velocity dependent form that avoids violations of current constraints on large scales. We demonstrate that our implementation accurately models not only core formation in haloes, but also gravothermal core collapse. For central haloes in cosmological volumes, frequent DM particle collisions isotropise the particles orbit, making them largely spherical. We show that the velocity-dependent $σ/m_χ$ models produce a large diversity in the circular velocities of satellites haloes, with the spread in velocities increasing as the cross sections reach 20, 60 and 100 cm$^2$/g in $10^9~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ haloes. The large variation in the haloes internal structure is driven by DM particles interactions, causing in some haloes the formation of extended cores, whereas in others gravothermal core collapse. We conclude that the SIDM models from the Tango project offer a promising explanation for the diversity in the density and velocity profiles of observed dwarf galaxies.},

@article{Cyr-Racine:2019aa,
  abstract      = {Gravitational lensing has emerged as a powerful probe of the matter distribution on subgalactic scales, which itself may contain important clues about the fundamental origins and properties of dark matter. Broadly speaking, two different approaches have been taken in the literature to map the small-scale structure of the Universe using strong lensing, with one focused on measuring the position and mass of a small number of discrete massive subhalos appearing close in projection to lensed images, and the other focused on detecting the collective effect of all the small-scale structure between the lensed source and the observer. In this paper, we follow the latter approach and perform a detailed study of the sensitivity of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses to the ensemble properties of small-scale structure. As in some previous studies, we adopt the language of the substructure power spectrum to characterize the statistical properties of the small-scale density field. We present a comprehensive theory that treats lenses with extended sources as well as those with time-dependent compact sources (such as quasars) in a unified framework for the first time. Our approach uses mode functions to provide both computational advantages and insights about couplings between the lens and source. The goal of this paper is to develop the theory and gain the intuition necessary to understand how the sensitivity to the substructure power spectrum depends on the source and lens properties, with the eventual aim of identifying the most promising targets for such studies.},

  abstract      = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) solves statistical inverse problems by repeatedly running a stochastic simulator and inferring posterior distributions from model-simulations. To improve simulation efficiency, several inference methods take a sequential approach and iteratively adapt the proposal distributions from which model simulations are generated. However, many of these sequential methods are difficult to use in practice, both because the resulting optimisation problems can be challenging and efficient diagnostic tools are lacking. To overcome these issues, we present Truncated Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (TSNPE). TSNPE performs sequential inference with truncated proposals, sidestepping the optimisation issues of alternative approaches. In addition, TSNPE allows to efficiently perform coverage tests that can scale to complex models with many parameters. We demonstrate that TSNPE performs on par with previous methods on established benchmark tasks. We then apply TSNPE to two challenging problems from neuroscience and show that TSNPE can successfully obtain the posterior distributions, whereas previous methods fail. Overall, our results demonstrate that TSNPE is an efficient, accurate, and robust inference method that can scale to challenging scientific models.},

@article{DiazRivero:2018aa,
  abstract      = {Strong gravitational lensing has been identified as a promising astrophysical probe to study the particle nature of dark matter. In this paper we present a detailed study of the power spectrum of the projected mass density (convergence) field of substructure in a Milky Way-sized halo. This power spectrum has been suggested as a key observable that can be extracted from strongly lensed images and yield important clues about the matter distribution within the lens galaxy. We use two different $N$-body simulations from the ETHOS framework: one with cold dark matter and another with self-interacting dark matter and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum. Despite earlier works that identified $ k \gtrsim 100$ kpc$^{-1}$ as the most promising scales to learn about the particle nature of dark matter we find that even at lower wavenumbers - which are actually within reach of observations in the near future - we can gain important information about dark matter. Comparing the amplitude and slope of the power spectrum on scales $0.1 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1} \lesssim 10$ from lenses at different redshifts can help us distinguish between cold dark matter and other exotic dark matter scenarios that alter the abundance and central densities of subhalos. Furthermore, by considering the contribution of different mass bins to the power spectrum we find that subhalos in the mass range $10^7 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ are on average the largest contributors to the power spectrum signal on scales $2 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1} \lesssim 15$, despite the numerous subhalos with masses $> 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ in a typical lens galaxy. Finally, by comparing the power spectra obtained from the subhalo catalogs to those from the particle data in the simulation snapshots we find that the seemingly-too-simple halo model is in fact a fairly good approximation to the much more complex array of substructure in the lens.},

  abstract      = {Likelihood-free inference refers to inference when a likelihood function cannot be explicitly evaluated, which is often the case for models based on simulators. Most of the literature is based on sample-based `Approximate Bayesian Computation' methods, but recent work suggests that approaches based on deep neural conditional density estimators can obtain state-of-the-art results with fewer simulations. The neural approaches vary in how they choose which simulations to run and what they learn: an approximate posterior or a surrogate likelihood. This work provides some direct controlled comparisons between these choices.},

@article{Durkan:2020aa,
  abstract      = {Likelihood-free methods perform parameter inference in stochastic simulator models where evaluating the likelihood is intractable but sampling synthetic data is possible. One class of methods for this likelihood-free problem uses a classifier to distinguish between pairs of parameter-observation samples generated using the simulator and pairs sampled from some reference distribution, which implicitly learns a density ratio proportional to the likelihood. Another popular class of methods fits a conditional distribution to the parameter posterior directly, and a particular recent variant allows for the use of flexible neural density estimators for this task. In this work, we show that both of these approaches can be unified under a general contrastive learning scheme, and clarify how they should be run and compared.},

@article{Gaia:2021aa,
  abstract      = {We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G_BP-G_RP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G_BP, and G_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 percent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the parallaxes and by a factor ~2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G_BP, and G_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1 percent level.},

We describe several recent algorithms and make connection with traditional approaches. We show advantages and limitations of models based on parametric approaches and we then draw attention to developments in machine learning, which we believe have the potential to make ABC scalable to higher dimensions and may be the future direction for research in this area.},

@article{Greenberg:2019aa,
  abstract      = {How can one perform Bayesian inference on stochastic simulators with intractable likelihoods? A recent approach is to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. However, existing methods are limited to a narrow range of proposal distributions or require importance weighting that can limit performance in practice. Here we present automatic posterior transformation (APT), a new sequential neural posterior estimation method for simulation-based inference. APT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated proposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density estimators. It is more flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based inference techniques. APT can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and image data, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.},

However, this rigour comes with a caveat that the Bayesian model is a precise reflection of Nature. There has been a recent trend to address potential model misspecification by raising the likelihood function to a power, primarily for robustness reasons, though not exclusively. In this paper we provide a coherent specification of the power parameter once the Bayesian model has been specified in the absence of a perfect model.},

  abstract      = {Accurate analyses of present and next-generation galaxy surveys require new ways to handle effects of non-linear gravitational structure formation in data. To address these needs we present an extension of our previously developed algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies to analyse matter clustering at non-linear scales in observations. This is achieved by incorporating a numerical particle mesh model of structure formation into our Bayesian inference framework. The algorithm simultaneously infers the 3D primordial matter fluctuations from which present non-linear observations formed and provides reconstructions of velocity fields and structure formation histories. The physical forward modelling approach automatically accounts for non-Gaussian features in evolved matter density fields and addresses the redshift space distortion problem associated with peculiar motions of galaxies. Our algorithm employs a hierarchical Bayes approach to jointly account for observational effects, such as galaxy biases, selection effects, and noise. Corresponding parameters are marginalized out via a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach relying on a combination of a multiple block sampling framework and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to the 2M++ galaxy compilation, tracing the matter distribution of the Nearby Universe. We show accurate and detailed inferences of the 3D non-linear dark matter distribution of the Nearby Universe. As exemplified in the case of the Coma cluster, we provide mass estimates that are compatible with those obtained from weak lensing and X-ray observations. For the first time, we reconstruct the vorticity of the non-linear velocity field from observations. In summary, our method provides plausible and detailed inferences of dark matter and velocity fields of our cosmic neighbourhood.},

  abstract      = {Analysis of galaxy--galaxy strong lensing systems is strongly dependent on any prior assumptions made about the appearance of the source. Here we present a method of imposing a data-driven prior / regularisation for source galaxies based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). We use a pre-trained model for galaxy images, AstroDDPM, and a chain of conditional reconstruction steps called denoising diffusion reconstruction model (DDRM) to obtain samples consistent both with the noisy observation and with the distribution of training data for AstroDDPM. We show that these samples have the qualitative properties associated with the posterior for the source model: in a low-to-medium noise scenario they closely resemble the observation, while reconstructions from uncertain data show greater variability, consistent with the distribution encoded in the generative model used as prior.},

  abstract      = {Image simulations are essential tools for preparing and validating the analysis of current and future wide-field optical surveys. However, the galaxy models used as the basis for these simulations are typically limited to simple parametric light profiles, or use a fairly limited amount of available space-based data. In this work, we propose a methodology based on Deep Generative Models to create complex models of galaxy morphologies that may meet the image simulation needs of upcoming surveys. We address the technical challenges associated with learning this morphology model from noisy and PSF-convolved images by building a hybrid Deep Learning/physical Bayesian hierarchical model for observed images, explicitly accounting for the Point Spread Function and noise properties. The generative model is further made conditional on physical galaxy parameters, to allow for sampling new light profiles from specific galaxy populations. We demonstrate our ability to train and sample from such a model on galaxy postage stamps from the HST/ACS COSMOS survey, and validate the quality of the model using a range of second- and higher-order morphology statistics. Using this set of statistics, we demonstrate significantly more realistic morphologies using these deep generative models compared to conventional parametric models. To help make these generative models practical tools for the community, we introduce GalSim-Hub, a community-driven repository of generative models, and a framework for incorporating generative models within the GalSim image simulation software.},

  abstract      = {Reconstructing astrophysical and cosmological fields from observations is challenging. It requires accounting for non-linear transformations, mixing of spatial structure, and noise. In contrast, forward simulators that map fields to observations are readily available for many applications. We present a versatile Bayesian field reconstruction algorithm rooted in simulation-based inference and enhanced by autoregressive modeling. The proposed technique is applicable to generic (non-differentiable) forward simulators and allows sampling from the posterior for the underlying field. We show first promising results on a proof-of-concept application: the recovery of cosmological initial conditions from late-time density fields.},

  abstract      = {Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.},

  abstract      = {Recent advances in probabilistic modelling have led to a large number of simulation-based inference algorithms which do not require numerical evaluation of likelihoods. However, a public benchmark with appropriate performance metrics for such 'likelihood-free' algorithms has been lacking. This has made it difficult to compare algorithms and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We set out to fill this gap: We provide a benchmark with inference tasks and suitable performance metrics, with an initial selection of algorithms including recent approaches employing neural networks and classical Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample efficiency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance, but there is no uniformly best algorithm. We provide practical advice and highlight the potential of the benchmark to diagnose problems and improve algorithms. The results can be explored interactively on a companion website. All code is open source, making it possible to contribute further benchmark tasks and inference algorithms.},

@article{Lukic:2019aa,
  abstract      = {Finding and classifying astronomical sources is key in the scientific exploitation of radio surveys. Source-finding usually involves identifying the parts of an image belonging to an astronomical source, against some estimated background. This can be problematic in the radio regime, owing to the presence of correlated noise, which can interfere with the signal from the source. In the current work, we present ConvoSource, a novel method based on a deep learning technique, to identify the positions of radio sources, and compare the results to a Gaussian-fitting method. Since the deep learning approach allows the generation of more training images, it should perform well in the source-finding task. We test the source-finding methods on artificial data created for the data challenge of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We investigate sources that are divided into three classes: star forming galaxies (SFGs) and two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The~artificial data are given at two different frequencies (560~MHz and 1400~MHz), three total integration times (8 h, 100 h, 1000 h), and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 1, 2, and 5. At~lower SNRs, ConvoSource tends to outperform a Gaussian-fitting approach in the recovery of SFGs and all sources, although at the lowest SNR of one, the better performance is likely due to chance matches. The~Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of the AGN-type sources at lower SNRs. At~a higher SNR, ConvoSource performs better on average in the recovery of AGN sources, whereas the Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of SFGs and all sources. ConvoSource usually performs better at shorter total integration times and detects more true positives and misses fewer sources compared to the Gaussian-fitting method; however, it detects more false positives.},

  abstract      = {Strong gravitational lenses provide an important tool to measure masses in the distant Universe, thus testing models for galaxy formation and dark matter; to investigate structure at the Epoch of Reionization; and to measure the Hubble constant and possibly w as a function of redshift. However, the limiting factor in all of these studies has been the currently small samples of known gravitational lenses (~10^2). The era of the SKA will transform our understanding of the Universe with gravitational lensing, particularly at radio wavelengths where the number of known gravitational lenses will increase to ~10^5. Here we discuss the technical requirements, expected outcomes and main scientific goals of a survey for strong gravitational lensing with the SKA. We find that an all-sky (3pi sr) survey carried out with the SKA1-MID array at an angular resolution of 0.25-0.5 arcsec and to a depth of 3 microJy / beam is required for studies of galaxy formation and cosmology with gravitational lensing. In addition, the capability to carryout VLBI with the SKA1 is required for tests of dark matter and studies of supermassive black holes at high redshift to be made using gravitational lensing.},

  abstract      = {Parametric stochastic simulators are ubiquitous in science, often featuring high-dimensional input parameters and/or an intractable likelihood. Performing Bayesian parameter inference in this context can be challenging. We present a neural simulation-based inference algorithm which simultaneously offers simulation efficiency and fast empirical posterior testability, which is unique among modern algorithms. Our approach is simulation efficient by simultaneously estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors instead of the joint posterior and by proposing simulations targeted to an observation of interest via a prior suitably truncated by an indicator function. Furthermore, by estimating a locally amortized posterior our algorithm enables efficient empirical tests of the robustness of the inference results. Since scientists cannot access the ground truth, these tests are necessary for trusting inference in real-world applications. We perform experiments on a marginalized version of the simulation-based inference benchmark and two complex and narrow posteriors, highlighting the simulator efficiency of our algorithm as well as the quality of the estimated marginal posteriors.},

@article{Neal:aa,
  abstract      = {Markov chain sampling methods that automatically adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed by exploiting the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice' defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Variations on such `slice sampling' methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling, and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially allow the sampling to adapt to dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done using `overrelaxed' versions of univariate slice sampling procedures, or by using `reflective' multivariate slice sampling methods, which bounce off the edges of the slice.},

To take the full benefit of the scientific potential of this giant, all the instruments will be equipped with Adaptive Optics (AO), providing the sharpest images. This paper provides a quick overview of the AO capabilities of the future instruments to be deployed at the ELT, highlight some of the expected performance and describe a couple of technical challenges that are still to tackle for an optimal scientific use. This paper has been presented at the "Societe Francaise d'Astronomie et Astrophysique" symposium in Bordeaux 2018, it is then naturally biased toward the French contribution for the ELT.},

  abstract      = {We present a new pixelized method for the inversion of gravitationally lensed extended source images which we term adaptive semi-linear inversion (SLI). At the heart of the method is an h-means clustering algorithm which is used to derive a source plane pixelization that adapts to the lens model magnification. The distinguishing feature of adaptive SLI is that every pixelization is derived from a random initialization, ensuring that data discretization is performed in a completely different and unique way for every lens model parameter set. We compare standard SLI on a fixed source pixel grid with the new method and demonstrate the shortcomings of the former when modeling singular power law ellipsoid (SPLE) lens profiles. In particular, we demonstrate the superior reliability and efficiency of adaptive SLI which, by design, fixes the number of degrees of freedom (NDOF) of the optimization and thereby removes biases present with other methods that allow the NDOF to vary. In addition, we highlight the importance of data discretization in pixel-based inversion methods, showing that adaptive SLI averages over significant systematics that are present when a fixed source pixel grid is used. In the case of the SPLE lens profile, we show how the method successfully samples its highly degenerate posterior probability distribution function with a single non-linear search. The robustness of adaptive SLI provides a firm foundation for the development of a strong lens modeling pipeline, which will become necessary in the short-term future to cope with the increasing rate of discovery of new strong lens systems.},

We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset. Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.},

  abstract      = {We present a systematic analysis of the constraints $\sigma_\gamma$ on the mass profile slope $\gamma$ obtainable when fitting a singular power-law ellipsoid model to a typical strong lensing observation of an extended source. These results extend our previous analysis of circular systems, Paper I. We draw our results from 676 mock observations covering a range of image configurations, each created with a fixed signal to noise ratio $S=100$ in the images. We analyse the results using a combination of theory and a simplified model which identifies the contribution to the constraints of the individual fluxes and positions in each of the lensed images. The main results are: 1. For any lens ellipticity, the constraints $\sigma_\gamma$ for two image systems are well described by the results of Paper I, transformed to elliptical coordinates; 2. We derive an analytical expression for $\sigma_\gamma$ for systems with the source aligned with the axis of the lens; 3. For both two-image systems and aligned systems, $\sigma_\gamma$ is limited by the flux uncertainties; 4. The constraints for off-axis four-image systems are a factor of two to eight better, depending on source size, than for two-image systems, and improve with increasing lens ellipticity. We show that the constraints on $\gamma$ in these systems derive from the complementary positional information of the images alone, without using flux. The complementarity improves as the offset of the source from the axis increases, such that the best constraints $\sigma_\gamma<0.01$, for $S=100$, occur when the source approaches the caustic.},

A sequential training procedure guides simulations and reduces simulation cost by orders of magnitude.

In this paper, we are interested in counting everything, that is to count objects from any category given only a few annotated instances from that category. To this end, we pose counting as a few-shot regression task. To tackle this task, we present a novel method that takes a query image together with a few exemplar objects from the query image and predicts a density map for the presence of all objects of interest in the query image. We also present a novel adaptation strategy to adapt our network to any novel visual category at test time, using only a few exemplar objects from the novel category. We also introduce a dataset of 147 object categories containing over 6000 images that are suitable for the few-shot counting task. The images are annotated with two types of annotation, dots and bounding boxes, and they can be used for developing few-shot counting models. Experiments on this dataset shows that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object detectors and few-shot counting approaches. Our code and dataset can be found at this https URL.},

  abstract      = {We present DECORAS, a deep learning based approach to detect both point and extended sources from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that uses a low number of convolutional layers to provide a scalable solution for source detection. In addition, DECORAS performs source characterization in terms of the position, effective radius and peak brightness of the detected sources. We have trained and tested the network with images that are based on realistic Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 20 cm. Also, these images have not gone through any prior de-convolution step and are directly related to the visibility data via a Fourier transform. We find that the source catalog generated by DECORAS has a better overall completeness and purity, when compared to a traditional source detection algorithm. DECORAS is complete at the 7.5$σ$ level, and has an almost factor of two improvement in reliability at 5.5$σ$. We find that DECORAS can recover the position of the detected sources to within 0.61 $\pm$ 0.69 mas, and the effective radius and peak surface brightness are recovered to within 20 per cent for 98 and 94 per cent of the sources, respectively. Overall, we find that DECORAS provides a reliable source detection and characterization solution for future wide-field VLBI surveys.},

  abstract      = {Density-ratio estimation via classification is a cornerstone of unsupervised learning. It has provided the foundation for state-of-the-art methods in representation learning and generative modelling, with the number of use-cases continuing to proliferate. However, it suffers from a critical limitation: it fails to accurately estimate ratios p/q for which the two densities differ significantly. Empirically, we find this occurs whenever the KL divergence between p and q exceeds tens of nats. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new framework, telescoping density-ratio estimation (TRE), that enables the estimation of ratios between highly dissimilar densities in high-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that TRE can yield substantial improvements over existing single-ratio methods for mutual information estimation, representation learning and energy-based modelling.},

@article{Rivero:2020aa,
  abstract      = {Strong gravitational lensing is a promising way of uncovering the nature of dark matter, by finding perturbations to images that cannot be well accounted for by modeling the lens galaxy without additional structure, be it subhalos (smaller halos within the smooth lens) or line-of-sight (LOS) halos. We present results attempting to infer the presence of substructure from images without requiring an intermediate step in which a smooth model has to be subtracted, using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). We find that the network is only able to infer the presence of subhalos with $>75\%$ accuracy when they have masses of $\geq 5 \times 10^9$M$_{\odot}$ if they lie within the main lens galaxy. Since less massive foreground LOS halos can have the same effect as higher mass subhalos, the CNN can probe lower masses in the halo mass function. The accuracy does not improve significantly if we add a population of less massive subhalos. With the expectation of experiments such as HST and Euclid yielding thousands of high-quality strong lensing images in the next years, having a way of analyzing images quickly to identify candidates that merit further analysis to determine individual subhalo properties while preventing extensive resources being used for images that would yield null detections could be very useful. By understanding the sensitivity as a function of substructure mass, non-detections could be combined with the information from images with substructure to constrain the cold dark matter scenario, in particular if the sensitivity can be pushed to lower masses.},

  abstract      = {The distribution of the non-luminous matter in galaxies of different luminosity and Hubble type is much more than a proof of the existence of dark particles governing the structures of the Universe. Here, we will review the complex but well-ordered scenario of the properties of the dark halos also in relation with those of the baryonic components they host. Moreover, we will present a number of tight and unexpected correlations between selected properties of the dark and the luminous matter. Such entanglement evolves across the varying properties of the luminous component and it seems to unequivocally lead to a dark particle able to interact with the Standard Model particles over cosmological times. This review will also focus on whether we need a paradigm shift, from pure collisionless dark particles emerging from "first principles", to particles that we can discover only by looking to how they have designed the structure of the galaxies. \keywords{Dark matter \and Galaxies \and Cosmology \and Elementary particles}},

@article{Simon:2019aa,
  abstract      = {For nearly 40 years, dark matter has been widely assumed to be cold and collisionless. Cold dark matter models make fundamental predictions for the behavior of dark matter on small (<10 kpc) scales. These predictions include cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass function that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest two observational programs relying on extremely large telescopes to critically test these predictions, and thus shed new light on the nature of dark matter. (1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy to measure the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf galaxies that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby universe. From these observations the inner slope of the dark matter density profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex, enabling a central cusp to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2) Diffraction-limited AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify the abundance of dark substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight. Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be sufficient to measure the halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10 Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the baryonic and stellar composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint self-consistent analysis mitigating limitations of either probe. This program will produce the strongest existing constraints on the properties of dark matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm, fuzzy, and self-interacting dark matter models.},

  abstract      = {Point source detection techniques are used to identify and localise point sources in radio astronomical surveys. With the development of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, survey images will see a massive increase in size from Gigapixels to Terapixels. Point source detection has already proven to be a challenge in recent surveys performed by SKA pathfinder telescopes. This paper proposes the Point Proposal Network (PPN): a point source detector that utilises deep convolutional neural networks for fast source detection. Results measured on simulated MeerKAT images show that, although less precise when compared to leading alternative approaches, PPN performs source detection faster and is able to scale to large images, unlike the alternative approaches.},

In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. "mixing" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. "mixing" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.},

  abstract      = {The Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (NADE) and its real-valued version RNADE are competitive density models of multidimensional data across a variety of domains. These models use a fixed, arbitrary ordering of the data dimensions. One can easily condition on variables at the beginning of the ordering, and marginalize out variables at the end of the ordering, however other inference tasks require approximate inference. In this work we introduce an efficient procedure to simultaneously train a NADE model for each possible ordering of the variables, by sharing parameters across all these models. We can thus use the most convenient model for each inference task at hand, and ensembles of such models with different orderings are immediately available. Moreover, unlike the original NADE, our training procedure scales to deep models. Empirically, ensembles of Deep NADE models obtain state of the art density estimation performance.},

They leverage the probability product rule and a weight sharing scheme inspired from restricted Boltzmann machines, to yield an estimator that is both tractable and has good generalization performance. We discuss how they achieve competitive performance in modeling both binary and real-valued observations. We also present how deep NADE models can be trained to be agnostic to the ordering of input dimensions used by the autoregressive product rule decomposition. Finally, we also show how to exploit the topological structure of pixels in images using a deep convolutional architecture for NADE.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for constraining substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies, be it from the presence of dark matter sub-halos or due to physical mechanisms affecting the baryons throughout galaxy evolution. Such substructure is hard to model and is either ignored by traditional, smooth modelling, approaches, or treated as well-localized massive perturbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to quantify the statistical properties of such perturbations directly from images, where only the extended lensed source features within a mask are considered, without the need of any lens modelling. Our training data consist of mock lensed images assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens potential, and, for the first time, using images of real galaxies as the lensed source. We employ a novel deep neural network that can handle arbitrary uncertainty intervals associated with the training dataset labels as input, provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss function. The method succeeds not only in accurately estimating the actual parameter values, but also reduces the predicted confidence intervals by 10 per cent in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without having access to the actual ground truth values. Our results are invariant to the inherent degeneracy between mass perturbations in the lens and complex brightness profiles for the source. Hence, we can quantitatively and robustly quantify the smoothness of the mass density of thousands of lenses, including confidence intervals, and provide a consistent ranking for follow-up science.},

@article{Vono:2020aa,
  abstract      = {Efficient sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution is an old but high-stake issue. Vanilla Cholesky samplers imply a computational cost and memory requirements which can rapidly become prohibitive in high dimension. To tackle these issues, multiple methods have been proposed from different communities ranging from iterative numerical linear algebra to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Surprisingly, no complete review and comparison of these methods have been conducted. This paper aims at reviewing all these approaches by pointing out their differences, close relations, benefits and limitations. In addition to this state of the art, this paper proposes a unifying Gaussian simulation framework by deriving a stochastic counterpart of the celebrated proximal point algorithm in optimization. This framework offers a novel and unifying revisit of most of the existing MCMC approaches while extending them. Guidelines to choose the appropriate Gaussian simulation method for a given sampling problem in high dimension are proposed and illustrated with numerical examples.},
