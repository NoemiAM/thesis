%I am also very grateful to Rafael Porto, who in many ways took on an informal role as my second advisor. He had been influential in encouraging me to venture into gravitational-wave physics, and I have since learned a lot from him about the field. Rafael's excitement about physics is always palpable during our discussions. He would never hesitate to provide me the most candid of advices when I needed them, which is something that I have always appreciated.

%I must thank my wonderful collaborator, John Stout, for his significant contributions to this thesis. Among his many strengths, John's patience, depth of thought, and Mathematica wizardry never cease to amaze me. We discussed physics from day to (mid)night, through which I have learned a lot from him. Though I occasionally regret his irreversible influence on me into compulsive daily-intake of coffee, I am glad to have known him as a great friend.

%Halfway through my PhD, Samaya Nissanke joined the university as a new faculty member. She has since become the light that brightens up the department through her compassion and openness to scientific research. Samaya's arrival has also attracted a large influx of experts in gravitational-wave physics to the department, many whom I have interacted regularly. Above all, I am grateful for her continuous support and encouragement.

%I'd also like to thank Asimina Arvanitaki and Savas Dimopoulos for sharing their insights in particle physics and inspiring me with their scientific creativity. Their insistences on me to provide numbers and do quick checks on the observability of an idea have certainly had an impact on the way I do science.

%Many other people have made my time in Amsterdam a great pleasure. To the cosmology group members: Matteo Biagetti, Carlos Duaso Pueyo,  Garrett Goon, Austin Joyce, Hayden Lee, Guilherme Pimentel, and  Benjamin Wallisch; thank you all for the great friendships. Group lunches and speakers' dinners will always be memorable times of my PhD. I'd also like to thank my fellow graduate students, to name a few: Gr\'egoire Mathys, Antonio Rotundo, Ka Wa Tsang, and Dong-Gang Wang, for making my graduate experience far more enjoyable.

%My graduate experience had been greatly enriched by my extended visits to the Henri Poincar\'e Institute, Perimeter Institute, and the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. I thank these institutes for their kind hospitality and for providing intellectually-stimulating environments. Special thanks to King's College London for always offering me a desk during my visits to London.

%As an engineering freshman eight years ago, I could not had foreseen myself switching to physics, let alone pursuing a doctorate in this field. For this I am grateful to Andrew Jardine and Matthew Wingate for supporting my transitions to the Cavendish Laboratory and DAMTP at Cambridge. %

%My family has played a pivotal role in my personal growth and development. A career in academic research is uncommon in our culture, yet they have shown unwavering support in my choices. To my mother, Audrey Chin, thank you for your unconditional love and for being my pillar of support. It is hard to overstate how important you have been to my upbringing. To my siblings, Shin Miin Chia and Shin Li Chia, thank you for all the memorable times we have spent together.

%More than anyone else, I am indebted to my late father, Ming Chew Chia, without whom none of the opportunities I have had would be possible. His perseverance against all odds has always been my source of inspiration. I cannot thank him enough for the love and care he had provided to our family.
