%In this chapter, we introduced a novel approach using \gls*{tmnre} to analyze strong gravitational lensing systems for dark matter science. Beginning with an overview of strong lensing and its potential to probe dark matter substructures, we developed a pipeline integrating \gls*{tmnre} to infer the cutoff mass in the dark matter halo mass function directly from simulated observations. We discussed the modeling complexities involved, including lens and source parameter uncertainties, substructure effects, and the validation of our methodology. Our results demonstrated that \gls*{tmnre} enables precise marginal and targeted inference, overcoming traditional computational challenges. We further showed the application of hierarchical inference to extract the dark matter cutoff mass signal from a population of substructures, paving the way for future advancements in dark matter characterization using strong lensing observations.
